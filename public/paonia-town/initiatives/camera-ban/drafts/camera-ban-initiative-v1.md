## COVER LETTER FOR SUBMISSION

[Date]

Town Clerk  
Town of Paonia  
214 Grand Avenue  
Paonia, CO 81428

**Re: Submission of Citizen Initiative Petition - Prohibition of Surveillance Cameras on Public Property**

Dear Town Clerk,

I hereby submit this citizen initiative petition which establishes legislative policy prohibiting government surveillance cameras on public property in the Town of Paonia.

**This Initiative is Clearly Legislative Because It:**

1. **Establishes fundamental policy** regarding government surveillance powers
2. **Sets limits on governmental authority** - a core legislative function
3. **Applies prospectively** to all future government actions
4. **Addresses policy matters** of privacy, civil liberties, and government powers
5. **Creates general rules** that apply uniformly to all Town operations

**The Initiative Does NOT:**
- Direct specific administrative actions
- Interfere with day-to-day operations
- Make individual contract decisions
- Address specific employees or departments

**This is Pure Policy-Making:**

The question of whether government should deploy surveillance cameras is a fundamental policy choice about:
- The balance between security and privacy
- The nature of government-citizen relations
- The character of our community
- The limits of government power

These are quintessentially legislative determinations appropriate for voter decision.

**Legal Framework:**

Per *Vagneur v. City of Aspen*, 295 P.3d 493 (Colo. 2013), courts must "liberally construe" the citizen initiative power. This initiative establishes broad policy constraints on government action - exactly the type of legislative act the initiative power was designed to enable.

Setting limits on government surveillance is analogous to other legislative acts like:
- Prohibiting certain zoning uses
- Restricting government spending authority  
- Establishing privacy protections
- Limiting police powers

**Timing Context:**

This initiative responds to the recent approval of a $50,000 surveillance camera contract, demonstrating active citizen engagement with current policy decisions. The People have the right to establish policy on this issue through the initiative process.

Please confirm receipt and acceptance of this petition for circulation within five (5) business days. Any concerns should be provided in writing.

The fundamental question - should our government engage in persistent surveillance of public spaces - is exactly the type of policy question voters should decide.

Respectfully submitted,

[Your Name]

## WHY THIS INITIATIVE IS BULLETPROOF:

### Clearly Legislative Elements:

1. **Policy Declaration** - "It shall be the policy of the Town..."
2. **Limits Government Power** - Classic legislative function
3. **General Application** - Applies to all departments equally
4. **Prospective Effect** - Governs future conduct
5. **No Individual Directives** - Doesn't tell specific people to do specific things

### Simple and Clean:
- Clear prohibition with limited exceptions
- No complex requirements that could be called administrative
- Focuses on policy, not implementation
- Addresses fundamental government powers

### Strong Legal Position:
- Setting limits on government surveillance = legislative
- Similar to laws limiting police powers, spending authority
- Courts recognize privacy/surveillance as policy matters
- Voter approval requirement emphasizes legislative nature

This initiative simply says: "The Town shall not use surveillance cameras on public property." That's pure policy-making that belongs to the People.
