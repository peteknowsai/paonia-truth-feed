## COVER LETTER FOR SUBMISSION

09/03/2025

Town Clerk  
Town of Paonia  
214 Grand Avenue  
Paonia, CO 81428

**Re: Submission of Citizen Initiative Petition - Electronic Communication Audit Log Transparency**

Dear Town Clerk,

I hereby submit this citizen initiative petition which establishes legislative policy requiring preservation and disclosure of electronic communication system audit logs.

**This Initiative is Clearly Legislative Because It:**

1. **Establishes transparency policy** for government records
2. **Sets retention standards** applying to all electronic systems
3. **Defines public records** classification for audit logs
4. **Creates general rules** for all Town operations
5. **Addresses government accountability** - a core legislative function

**The Initiative Does NOT:**
- Direct specific administrative acts
- Require creation of new records
- Interfere with day-to-day operations
- Impose burdensome requirements

**Simple and Reasonable:**

This initiative simply requires the Town to:
- Keep the audit logs that systems automatically generate
- Provide them when requested under CORA
- Not delete or disable audit logging

These logs already exist. This just ensures they're preserved and available for public oversight.

**Technology-Neutral Approach:**

By referring to "electronic communication systems" rather than specific platforms, this ordinance remains effective regardless of whether the Town uses Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, or any future system.

**Legal Framework:**

Per *Vagneur v. City of Aspen*, 295 P.3d 493 (Colo. 2013), the initiative power must be "liberally construed." Establishing transparency and records retention policies is quintessentially legislative.

This is analogous to:
- Open records laws
- Records retention schedules
- Transparency requirements
- Public meeting rules

All of these set policy about government openness - exactly what this initiative does.

**Public Interest:**

Recent refusals to provide Microsoft 365 audit logs, claiming "no responsive records," demonstrate the need for clear policy. These logs exist and should be available for public oversight.

Transparency is fundamental to democratic governance. The People have the right to establish policies ensuring government activities are documented and available for review.

**Minimal Burden:**

- Audit logs are generated automatically
- No new work required
- Standard practice in most organizations
- Only provided when specifically requested
- Uses existing CORA procedures

Please confirm receipt and acceptance of this petition for circulation within five (5) business days. Any concerns should be provided in writing.

The question of government transparency and records preservation is exactly the type of policy matter voters should decide.

Respectfully submitted,

Pete McCarthy
119 1/2 Dorris Ave, Paonia, CO 81428

     Mayor

## WHY THIS VERSION WORKS:

### Simple Requirements:
1. **Preserve** what already exists (3 years)
2. **Provide** when requested via CORA
3. **Don't disable** audit logging

### Technology-Neutral:
- Works for Microsoft 365 (current)
- Works for Google Workspace
- Works for any future system
- Covers any "electronic communication system"

### Reasonable Scope:
- Only audit logs (not email content)
- Only when requested (not automatic posting)
- Standard retention period (3 years)
- Normal CORA procedures apply

### Clear Legislative Nature:
- Sets policy on transparency
- Defines public records
- Establishes retention requirements
- Creates enforcement mechanisms

This initiative simply says: "Keep the logs your system already makes and provide them when asked." That's reasonable, simple, and clearly legislative.
