## COVER LETTER FOR SUBMISSION

09/03/2025

Town Clerk  
Town of Paonia  
214 Grand Avenue  
Paonia, CO 81428

**Re: Submission of Citizen Initiative Petition - Executive Session Transparency**

Dear Town Clerk,

I hereby submit this citizen initiative petition which establishes legislative policy requiring clear standards for executive sessions and eventual public release of recordings when the legal basis for confidentiality expires.

**This Initiative is Clearly Legislative Because It:**

1. **Establishes transparency policy** for how government meetings are conducted
2. **Sets procedural standards** that apply prospectively to all future executive sessions
3. **Creates accountability requirements** for documenting the purpose of closed meetings
4. **Defines release timelines** based on when confidentiality reasons expire
5. **Protects democratic oversight** - a fundamental legislative function

**The Initiative Does NOT:**
- Direct any specific administrative action
- Interfere with lawful executive sessions
- Require immediate disclosure of sensitive matters
- Violate attorney-client or other legitimate privileges
- Change any past actions or decisions

**Current Law Already Requires Recording:**

The Town already records executive sessions. This initiative simply ensures:
- Clear statements of purpose before entering executive session
- Eventual public release when confidentiality expires
- Independent review process for disputed sessions
- Protection of legitimate confidentiality during active matters

**Legal Framework:**

Per *Vagneur v. City of Aspen*, 295 P.3d 493 (Colo. 2013), the initiative power must be "liberally construed." Establishing transparency standards for government meetings is quintessentially legislative.

Colorado Open Meetings Law, C.R.S. ยง 24-6-402, already requires open meetings with limited exceptions. This initiative ensures those exceptions are properly used and documented.

**Recent Examples Demonstrate Need:**

- Executive sessions held about "Initiative Petitions" after already decided
- Vague announcements like "legal advice" without specifying the matter
- No mechanism for public to know when litigation ends and recordings should be released
- No accountability when executive sessions exceed their stated purpose

**Reasonable Timeline for Release:**

The initiative provides clear, reasonable timelines:
- Two years for routine matters
- When litigation concludes
- When contracts are finalized
- When the stated reason for confidentiality no longer exists

This protects legitimate confidentiality while ensuring eventual transparency.

**Standard Practice in Colorado:**

Many Colorado municipalities already:
- Record all executive sessions
- Release recordings when matters conclude
- Provide for independent review of disputed sessions
- Maintain clear documentation of session purposes

Paonia should meet these basic transparency standards.

Please confirm receipt and acceptance of this petition for circulation within five (5) business days. Any concerns should be provided in writing with specific statutory citations.

The fundamental question - how much transparency should citizens expect from executive sessions - is exactly the type of policy question voters must decide.

Respectfully submitted,

Pete McCarthy  
119 1/2 Dorris Ave, Paonia, CO 81428

## WHY THIS INITIATIVE IS POWERFUL:

### Direct Response to Abuse:
- June 10 executive session about already-rejected initiative
- Pattern of using executive sessions to avoid public scrutiny
- No current mechanism to verify proper use

### Reasonable Requirements:
- Recording is simple and cheap
- Release delayed to protect legitimate confidentiality
- Independent review prevents frivolous releases
- Many cities already do this

### Strong Enforcement:
- Actions taken in improper sessions are voidable
- Personal liability for knowing violations
- Attorney fees for citizens who prevail
- Burden on Town to prove propriety

### Clear Legislative Nature:
- Sets policy on government transparency
- Creates procedural requirements
- Establishes accountability standards
- Defines public rights

This would be a game-changer - they couldn't hide behind executive session anymore.
