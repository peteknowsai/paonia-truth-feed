### RECITALS

**WHEREAS**, the People of Paonia elect trustees to represent their interests and provide oversight of town operations; and

**WHEREAS**, trustees who received 227 votes from the People have been removed by as few as 5 votes from other trustees; and

**WHEREAS**, the ability of a simple majority to remove duly elected officials undermines the will of the voters and democratic governance; and

### Section 1. Policy Established.

It shall be the policy of the Town of Paonia that elected trustees serve at the will of the People who elected them, not at the pleasure of their fellow board members. Removal of elected officials undermines democratic governance and should occur only in the most extraordinary circumstances with overwhelming consensus.

(c) **Protected Activities.** The following shall never constitute grounds for removal:
   1. Filing Colorado Open Records Act requests
   2. Requesting audits or investigations
   3. Voting contrary to the majority
   4. Speaking at public comment periods
   5. Communicating with constituents about town business
   6. Questioning staff or contractor actions

### Section 3. Procedural Protections.

(a) **Notice Requirements.** Any removal proceeding must provide:
   1. Written charges at least 30 days before any hearing
   2. Specific factual allegations, not conclusions
   3. Opportunity for written response

## COVER LETTER FOR SUBMISSION

09/03/2025

Town Clerk  
Town of Paonia  
214 Grand Avenue  
Paonia, CO 81428

**Re: Submission of Citizen Initiative Petition - Trustee Protection from Removal**

Dear Town Clerk,

I hereby submit this citizen initiative petition which establishes legislative policy requiring unanimous consent for the removal of elected trustees.

**This Initiative is Clearly Legislative Because It:**

1. **Establishes fundamental governance policy** about the removal of elected officials
2. **Sets procedural standards** that apply prospectively to all future removal proceedings
3. **Creates structural rules** for government operation
4. **Protects democratic institutions** - a core legislative function
5. **Defines the relationship** between elected officials and voters

**The Initiative Does NOT:**
- Direct any specific personnel action
- Address any individual trustee
- Interfere with day-to-day operations
- Make administrative decisions

**Pure Legislative Policy-Making:**

This initiative addresses how our democratic government functions - specifically, when and how elected representatives can be removed from office. This is quintessentially legislative, similar to:
- Term limit laws
- Recall provisions
- Ethics standards
- Procedural requirements for government action

**Context and Public Interest:**

The recent removal of Trustee Bill Brunner by a 5-1 vote, despite receiving 227 votes from citizens, demonstrates the need for this reform. When one trustee elected by hundreds can be removed by five trustees, democratic governance is undermined.

The ability of administrators to leverage removal threats (as when Town Administrator Wynn threatened resignation unless Brunner was removed) creates an unhealthy dynamic where unelected staff can manipulate elected boards.

**Legal Framework:**

Per *Vagneur v. City of Aspen*, 295 P.3d 493 (Colo. 2013), the initiative power must be "liberally construed." Establishing standards for removing elected officials is a fundamental legislative act about governmental structure.

This is analogous to state laws requiring supermajorities for impeachment, constitutional amendments, or other extraordinary governmental actions. The People have the right to establish how their elected representatives may be removed.

**Key Legislative Elements:**

- Creates general rules applying to all trustees equally
- Establishes procedural requirements
- Sets burden of proof standards
- Defines protected activities
- Provides enforcement mechanisms

These are classic legislative functions establishing the framework of government.

Please confirm receipt and acceptance of this petition for circulation within five (5) business days. Any concerns should be provided in writing.

The fundamental question - should elected officials be removable by simple majority or require unanimous consent - is exactly the type of structural governance question voters should decide.

Respectfully submitted,

Pete McCarthy 
119 1/2 Dorris Ave, Paonia, CO 81428

## WHY THIS INITIATIVE IS BULLETPROOF:

### Clearly Legislative:

1. **Structural Governance** - Defines how government operates
2. **Procedural Standards** - Sets rules for removal proceedings
3. **General Application** - Applies to all trustees equally
4. **Prospective Effect** - Governs future conduct
5. **Democratic Protection** - Preserves voter choices

### Strong Legal Position:

- Similar to impeachment standards (requiring supermajority)
- Like term limits or recall provisions (structural rules)
- Protects constitutional rights (due process, speech)
- Preserves voter sovereignty

### Key Context from Brunner Removal:

- **Vote**: 5-1 to remove (Brunner couldn't vote on his own removal)
- **Elected**: Brunner received 227 votes from citizens
- **Charges**: "Harassment" for pursuing CORA requests
- **Manipulation**: Administrator threatened to resign unless removal occurred
- **Chilling Effect**: Removes trustees who provide oversight

This initiative ensures that the 227 voters who elected a trustee cannot have their choice overturned by just 5 other trustees.
