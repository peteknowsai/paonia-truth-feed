## COVER LETTER FOR SUBMISSION

09/03/2025

Town Clerk  
Town of Paonia  
214 Grand Avenue  
Paonia, CO 81428

**Re: Submission of Citizen Initiative Petition - Short-Term Rental Regulation**

Dear Town Clerk,

I hereby resubmit this citizen initiative petition which establishes legislative policy protecting the fundamental right of residents to host guests in their principal residence.

**This Initiative is Clearly Legislative Because It:**

1. **Eliminates existing fees** - a quintessential legislative act
2. **Creates regulatory categories** distinguishing resident from non-resident rentals
3. **Establishes prospective policy** applying to all future STR operations
4. **Makes fundamental policy choices** about property rights and regulation
5. **Phases out certain uses** while protecting others - classic legislative line-drawing

**The Initiative Does NOT:**
- Direct specific administrative actions
- Address individual properties or owners
- Interfere with day-to-day operations
- Create administrative burdens

**Your Previous Rejection Was In Error:**

You claimed this initiative "establishes fees" when it explicitly ELIMINATES them. This fundamental misreading suggests either:
- The rejection was predetermined without actual review
- There is a concerning lack of attention to citizen initiatives
- The rejection was made in bad faith


**Context - The Voter Mandate:**

On April 1, 2025, 70.4% of Paonia voters rejected restrictive STR regulations. This initiative honors that overwhelming mandate by protecting resident hosting rights while addressing community concerns about investor-owned rentals.

**Legal Framework:**

Per *City of Idaho Springs v. Blackwell*, 731 P.2d 1250 (Colo. 1987), creating regulatory categories and eliminating fees are legislative acts. Per *Margolis v. District Court*, 638 P.2d 297 (Colo. 1981), prospective regulations are legislative.

As a STATUTORY TOWN, Paonia must follow C.R.S. ยง 31-11-104, which grants broad initiative powers. Your attempt to narrow these powers contradicts both statute and precedent.


**Key Legislative Elements:**

- Eliminates all fees for resident hosting
- Creates distinct regulatory categories
- Establishes sunset provisions
- Requires voter approval for changes
- Sets prospective policy standards

These are textbook legislative functions that belong to the People.

Please confirm receipt and acceptance of this petition for circulation within five (5) business days. Any concerns should be provided in writing with specific statutory citations.

The fundamental question - should residents be free to host guests in their own homes without government fees or interference - is exactly the type of policy question voters must decide.

Respectfully submitted,

Pete McCarthy
