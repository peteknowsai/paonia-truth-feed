# Initiative Explanations for Paonia Voters

## 1. SHORT-TERM RENTAL REGULATION INITIATIVE

### What This Initiative Does

This initiative establishes clear, permanent rules for short-term rentals (STRs) in Paonia that protect property rights while addressing community concerns. 

The initiative creates two distinct categories of STRs with different rules. First, it fully legalizes "resident-occupied" STRs - where the owner or long-term tenant lives on the property at least 183 days per year. These residents can host guests in their principal residence without any fees, licenses, permits, or special review processes. They can rent individual rooms or their entire home when traveling. The Town cannot regulate these resident hosts in any way.

Second, it addresses "non-resident" or investor-owned STRs. All new non-resident STRs are immediately prohibited - no new investor rentals can begin operating. Existing non-resident STRs are treated differently based on property type: those in multi-family or commercial buildings can continue operating indefinitely (grandfathered), while those in single-family homes must cease operations by June 30, 2026.

The initiative includes important democratic safeguards. Any future fees or extension of the 2026 sunset date requires direct voter approval - the Town Board cannot impose these unilaterally. Violations are enforceable under existing Municipal Code provisions. The ordinance takes effect 30 days after election certification.

### Why Paonia Needs This Initiative

**Voter Mandate Already Expressed**: On April 1, 2025, an overwhelming 70.4% of Paonia voters rejected the Town's restrictive STR ordinance. This wasn't a close vote - it was a landslide rejection of overregulation. Despite this clear mandate, the Town continues trying to restrict and extract fees from STRs. This initiative honors what voters already decided.

**Protects Fundamental Property Rights**: Hosting guests in your own home is a basic property right. Whether it's family visiting for holidays, friends staying for a festival, or paying guests helping with the mortgage, what residents do in their principal residence shouldn't require government permission. The current ordinance treats a spare bedroom the same as a hotel - requiring ADA compliance, off-street parking, and expensive permits that make hosting economically impossible for regular residents.

**Addresses Real Concerns About Investor STRs**: While protecting resident rights, this initiative acknowledges legitimate concerns about outside investors buying up housing stock. By prohibiting new investor STRs and phasing out single-family investor rentals by 2026, it strikes a balance. Multi-family and commercial properties can continue because they don't impact single-family neighborhood character.

**Stops Fee Extraction**: The Town Clerk rejected this initiative claiming it "establishes fees" when it actually ELIMINATES them. This reveals their true concern: losing a revenue source. But STRs already pay state sales tax, county lodging taxes, and local taxes. If the Town genuinely needs additional revenue, they should ask voters - not block initiatives that eliminate fees.

**Prevents Selective Enforcement**: Current vague regulations allow arbitrary enforcement. Clear, voter-approved rules prevent the Town from targeting certain residents while ignoring others. Everyone knows where they stand.

**Supports Local Economy**: Paonia depends on tourism. Resident-hosted STRs provide authentic local experiences that hotels can't match. Visitors stay in neighborhoods, shop locally, and often return. Killing STRs hurts small businesses that depend on tourist traffic.

## 2. AUTONOMOUS ROBOT MORATORIUM INITIATIVE

### What This Initiative Does

This initiative establishes a temporary moratorium on autonomous robots operating in Paonia's public spaces, giving the community time to develop appropriate regulations through democratic process.

The moratorium prohibits any person or entity from operating "autonomous robots" in public spaces within Town limits. An autonomous robot is defined as any self-propelled device operating without continuous human control. Public spaces include streets, sidewalks, parks, and other areas accessible to the public. This covers delivery robots, surveillance drones operating autonomously, and similar devices that navigate our community without direct human operation.

The initiative includes a critical exemption for emergency response robots operated by public safety agencies - firefighting drones, search-and-rescue robots, or police bomb-disposal units can still operate when needed. The moratorium explicitly does not establish any fees, licenses, or permits - it's a simple prohibition while policy is developed.

Violations are civil infractions that can be reported by any person - citizens can call in autonomous robots just like any other code violation. The moratorium automatically expires December 31, 2027, creating a natural deadline for the Town to develop proper regulations through public process. The initiative encourages but doesn't require the Town to develop a regulatory framework during this period.

### Why Paonia Needs This Initiative

**Mysterious Deployment Without Notice**: In June 2025, autonomous robots suddenly appeared on Paonia streets. No public announcement. No explanation of their purpose. No identification of who operates them. No opportunity for citizen input. Residents discovered surveillance-capable technology roaming their neighborhoods without warning. This unilateral deployment demonstrates why we need democratic control over emerging technology.

**Privacy and Surveillance Concerns**: These robots likely have cameras and sensors. Who operates them? What data do they collect? Where is it stored? Who has access? The timing is suspicious - robots appear just as the Town approves $50,000 in surveillance cameras and blocks citizen initiatives. Without transparency, we must assume the worst about surveillance capabilities.

**Public Safety Issues**: Autonomous robots share sidewalks with children, elderly residents, and people with disabilities. What happens when a robot blocks a wheelchair? When a child chases one into traffic? When a dog attacks one defending its territory? Without safety protocols, accidents are inevitable.

**Democratic Process Bypassed**: Major technology deployments affecting public spaces deserve public discussion. Instead, someone - we still don't know who - decided Paonia should have robots roaming its streets. This moratorium restores democratic control, forcing a pause until residents can weigh in.

**Sets Precedent for Future Technology**: If we allow autonomous robots without public input, what's next? Facial recognition? Drone surveillance? By establishing that new technology requires democratic approval, we protect against future intrusions.

**Reasonable Temporary Measure**: This isn't a permanent ban. The 2027 sunset gives ample time for thoughtful regulation. Communities worldwide are grappling with these issues - we can learn from their experiences. The moratorium creates breathing room for good policy.

**Pattern of Surveillance Expansion**: The robot deployment fits a disturbing pattern: blocking democratic participation while expanding surveillance. The Town rejects citizen initiatives, holds illegal secret meetings, and removes oversight-minded trustees - while simultaneously deploying robots and cameras. This initiative draws a line.

## 3. SURVEILLANCE CAMERA PROHIBITION INITIATIVE

### What This Initiative Does

This initiative establishes a clear policy prohibiting government surveillance cameras on public property in Paonia, protecting privacy rights and community character while allowing specific exceptions for transparency and safety.

The prohibition is comprehensive: the Town cannot install, operate, or maintain surveillance cameras on any public property including streets, sidewalks, parks, buildings, facilities, and rights-of-way. This covers the recently approved $50,000 Verkada camera system. The Town also cannot circumvent this through third-party contracts - no hiring companies to operate cameras for them. Additionally, the Town cannot access feeds from private cameras monitoring public spaces.

Any existing surveillance cameras must be permanently disabled and removed within 90 days of the ordinance taking effect. This isn't a pause or restriction - it's complete removal of government surveillance infrastructure from public spaces.

The initiative includes three narrow exceptions: temporary cameras for live-streaming public meetings (recordings must be publicly available and deleted after 30 days), body-worn cameras on law enforcement (governed by separate policy), and temporary cameras for specific criminal investigations with a warrant. These exceptions balance transparency and legitimate law enforcement needs.

Enforcement has teeth: any contracts violating this ordinance are void, citizens can seek injunctive relief to force compliance, and officials who knowingly violate it commit official misconduct. Most importantly, this ordinance can only be amended or repealed by voters - the Town Board cannot overturn it.

### Why Paonia Needs This Initiative

**Surveillance System Just Approved**: While claiming no resources for democratic processes, the Town found $50,000 for Verkada surveillance cameras. The system monitors Town Hall, the public park, and water facilities with cloud storage and remote access for police, public works, and the Town Administrator. This expansion happened without meaningful public input.

**Privacy Rights in Small Towns Matter More**: In a city, you're anonymous. In Paonia, cameras record your daily patterns - when you walk your dog, who you meet for coffee, which meetings you attend. Government surveillance in a small town enables social control in ways that would be impossible in Denver. Everyone knows everyone - surveillance data becomes gossip, then leverage.

**Chilling Effect on Democratic Participation**: Cameras at Town Hall and parks monitor who attends protests, who speaks at meetings, who associates with "troublemakers." The same Administrator who threatened resignation to force out an oversight-minded trustee now has camera access. Would you speak out knowing you're being watched and recorded?

**No Evidence Cameras Improve Safety**: Studies show surveillance cameras don't prevent crime - they just move it. Paonia doesn't have a crime wave requiring surveillance. This is about control, not safety. The Town wants to watch citizens while hiding its own activities in illegal executive sessions.

**Cloud Storage Creates Permanent Records**: Verkada uses cloud storage - your movements become permanent records stored who-knows-where, accessible to who-knows-whom. Data breaches, government requests, employee abuse - once recorded, privacy is lost forever. Small town surveillance creates detailed dossiers on every resident.

**Pattern of Surveillance Without Democracy**: Surveillance expands while democracy contracts. The Town deploys mysterious robots, approves cameras, and blocks citizen initiatives. They're building surveillance infrastructure while dismantling democratic oversight. This initiative stops that pattern.

**Voter Control Over Future Changes**: If crime genuinely becomes a problem requiring cameras, voters can approve them. But that decision belongs to the people, not seven trustees meeting in secret. This initiative ensures surveillance requires democratic consent.

**Colorado Towns Are Rejecting Surveillance**: Communities across Colorado are pushing back against government surveillance. We can be leaders in protecting privacy and community character, showing that safety doesn't require surrendering freedom.

## 4. ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION TRANSPARENCY INITIATIVE

### What This Initiative Does

This initiative requires the Town to preserve and provide electronic communication system audit logs - the automatic records that track government digital activities - ensuring transparency and accountability in the digital age.

The initiative mandates preservation of all audit logs from any electronic communication system (email, messaging, collaboration platforms) used for Town business for a minimum of three years. These logs must be maintained at the highest level of detail available in the system. Audit logs include user login/logout times and locations, email sent/received timestamps and parties, file access and modifications, account changes, administrative actions, and deletion activities. The Town cannot disable, circumvent, or reduce audit log generation.

These audit logs become public records subject to the Colorado Open Records Act (CORA). Upon request, the Town must provide them within three working days (or seven with extension) and can only charge fees authorized by statute. The Town may only withhold information falling under specific CORA exceptions like attorney-client privilege or security arrangements.

The initiative prohibits deleting or altering audit logs except per retention schedule, using personal email to circumvent requirements, or disabling audit functionality. Violations constitute unlawful destruction of public records with both criminal and civil penalties. Citizens can seek injunctive relief and attorney fees for arbitrary denials. The Town must report quarterly on compliance.

Implementation must occur within 30 days of the effective date. Importantly, this doesn't require creating new records - only preserving the audit logs that Microsoft 365 and other systems already generate automatically.

### Why Paonia Needs This Initiative

**Town Claims "No Responsive Records" for Logs That Exist**: When citizens request Microsoft 365 audit logs to verify public business is conducted properly, the Town claims no records exist. This is false - Microsoft 365 automatically generates detailed audit logs. They're either lying about their existence or deliberately not preserving them. Either way, it's obstruction.

**Digital Age Requires Digital Transparency**: Government business increasingly happens via email and digital platforms. Without audit logs, there's no way to verify if officials use personal email to avoid CORA, delete embarrassing communications, or conduct business in secret. These logs are the digital equivalent of meeting minutes - essential for accountability.

**Pattern of Records Destruction Suspected**: The timing of "no responsive records" claims is suspicious. Requests about controversial decisions consistently yield nothing. Are they deleting records? Using personal accounts? Without audit logs, we can't know. This initiative ensures a permanent, unalterable record exists.

**No Additional Work Required**: This isn't burdensome - audit logs generate automatically. Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, and similar systems create these logs by default. The Town just needs to not delete them and provide them when requested. It's literally easier to comply than to obstruct.

**Prevents "Oops, We Deleted That" Excuses**: With mandatory three-year retention and criminal penalties for deletion, officials can't conveniently "lose" records about controversial decisions. The audit log shows if someone deleted emails about the STR rejection, Brunner removal, or illegal executive sessions.

**Reveals Hidden Communications**: Audit logs show login patterns, email traffic, and file access. They reveal if officials coordinate off-hours to avoid public scrutiny, if certain citizens' requests get ignored, or if records get altered after-the-fact. It's pattern evidence of how government really operates.

**Standard Practice in Professional Organizations**: Any competent organization preserves audit logs for security, compliance, and troubleshooting. The Town's failure to maintain these basic records suggests either incompetence or deliberate obstruction. This initiative mandates professional standards.

**Quarterly Reporting Ensures Compliance**: The required compliance reports create ongoing accountability. The Town must publicly confirm they're preserving logs properly. No more claiming ignorance or technical difficulties when citizens request records.

## 5. EXECUTIVE SESSION TRANSPARENCY INITIATIVE

### What This Initiative Does

This initiative builds on the Town's current practice of recording executive sessions by requiring detailed purpose statements and establishing clear timelines for when recordings become public, particularly when legal matters conclude.

The Town must continue recording all executive sessions in their entirety. The key change is requiring detailed announcements before entering executive session: not just citing a statute, but stating the PARTICULAR matter (e.g., "negotiations regarding the Smith property purchase" not just "real estate"), explaining how it fits the legal exception, and stating when recordings will become public.

Most importantly, recordings become public automatically when the legal justification ends: immediately when litigation concludes (final judgment or settlement), when contracts are executed or negotiations terminated, when personnel matters resolve, or after two years for other matters. This means no more permanent secrecy - when the lawsuit ends, the public learns what was discussed.


The initiative prohibits executive sessions for general discussions, matters already decided publicly, political strategy, or avoiding scrutiny. It prohibits disabling recordings, editing them, or holding "informal" meetings to avoid requirements. Upon complaint, neutral third parties review recordings in camera to determine if improper discussions occurred. The Town bears the burden of proving proper use. Violations result in immediate public release, nullification of actions taken, and personal liability for officials.

### Why Paonia Needs This Initiative

**June 10, 2025 Illegal Session Proves Need**: The Board held an executive session about "Initiative Petitions" 15 days AFTER already rejecting the STR initiative. There's no legal basis for secret discussion of already-decided matters. This violates Colorado Open Meetings Law. Without recordings, we can't prove what they discussed or hold them accountable.

**Pattern of Hiding Behind Executive Session**: Controversial decisions consistently involve executive sessions. The Brunner removal, STR rejection, surveillance expansion - all involve secret meetings. They're using executive session as a shield against public scrutiny, discussing matters that belong in public.

**Vague Purpose Statements Hide True Discussions**: Currently, they announce "personnel matters" or "legal advice" without specifics. Which personnel? What legal issue? This initiative requires stating the PARTICULAR matter - if you're discussing the Smith lawsuit, say so. If it's about the Johnson contract, name it. Specificity prevents abuse.

**Permanent Secrecy Enables Abuse**: Even though they record, there's no clear requirement for release. This initiative ensures recordings become public when the reason for secrecy ends. When the lawsuit settles, when the contract is signed, when the employee issue resolves - the public deserves to know what was discussed in their name.

**Delayed Release Protects Legitimate Confidentiality**: The initiative doesn't require immediate release. Sensitive matters remain confidential for years. But eventually, sunlight disinfects. Knowing recordings will eventually be public keeps discussions proper.

**Burden of Proof on Government**: Currently, citizens must prove improper use without access to evidence. This initiative flips that - the Town must prove executive sessions were proper. If they're following the law, this is easy. If not, they'll be exposed.

**Personal Liability Changes Behavior**: Knowing they face personal liability for improper sessions will make officials think twice. No more casual retreat to executive session when public discussion gets uncomfortable. The stakes become real.

**Independent Review Prevents Abuse**: Neutral third parties review recordings when challenged, preventing both frivolous releases and continued secrecy. This balanced approach protects legitimate confidentiality while exposing abuse.

## 6. TRUSTEE PROTECTION INITIATIVE

### What This Initiative Does

This initiative protects democratically elected trustees from politically motivated removal by requiring unanimous consent of all other trustees, ensuring that officials who exercise oversight and ask tough questions cannot be silenced through simple majority votes.

The initiative establishes that no elected trustee may be removed except by unanimous vote of ALL other seated trustees, recall election by voters, or conviction of a felony. Abstentions and recusals count as votes against removal - there's no hiding behind procedural moves. Vacant seats don't count in determining unanimity.

Certain activities are explicitly protected from ever being grounds for removal: filing Colorado Open Records Act requests, requesting audits or investigations, voting contrary to the majority, speaking at public comment periods, communicating with constituents about town business, and questioning staff or contractor actions. These are core functions of elected officials that cannot be punished.

The initiative requires robust due process: written charges at least 30 days before any hearing with specific factual allegations (not vague conclusions), opportunity for written response, and public hearing with the right to present evidence. Those seeking removal must prove charges by clear and convincing evidence. Trustees facing removal for actions related to official duties get counsel at town expense.

The initiative prohibits retaliation - no employee, administrator, or contractor can threaten resignation or adverse action to coerce trustee removal. Any contract or employment agreement contingent on trustee removal is void. Voters can override any removal within 30 days by petition of 10% of registered electors, triggering a special election. Wrongfully removed trustees are immediately reinstated.

### Why Paonia Needs This Initiative

**Bill Brunner's Removal Shows the Danger**: Trustee Bill Brunner received 227 votes from citizens. He was removed by just 5 trustees (5-1 vote, with Brunner unable to vote on his own removal) - overturning the will of 227 voters with 5 votes. His "crime"? Filing CORA requests, demanding transparency, and winning a lawsuit against the Town for violating open records law. He was doing exactly what voters elected him to do - provide oversight.

**Administrator Manipulation Must Stop**: Town Administrator Stefen Wynn threatened to resign unless Brunner was removed. An unelected bureaucrat essentially forced elected officials to remove their colleague. This reverses democratic accountability - administrators work for elected officials, not vice versa. This initiative prevents such extortion.

**Chilling Effect on All Trustees**: Every trustee now knows that asking tough questions, requesting records, or challenging staff could lead to removal. They've seen what happened to Brunner. This chills oversight and enables administrative abuse. When trustees fear removal, democracy fails.

**Simple Majority Removal Is Anti-Democratic**: One trustee represents hundreds of voters. When 5 trustees can remove a sixth, they're disenfranchising those voters. Removal should be extraordinary, requiring overwhelming consensus or direct voter action - not simple majority politics.

**Oversight Is Not Harassment**: The Town called Brunner's CORA requests "harassment." But oversight IS the job. Requesting public records, questioning expenditures, and demanding transparency are core functions of elected officials. This initiative clarifies that oversight cannot be punished.

**Protects Minority Voices**: In any board, minority voices provide essential perspective. If the majority can simply remove dissenting trustees, boards become echo chambers. Democracy requires protecting unpopular opinions and uncomfortable questions.

**Voters Deserve Final Say**: If trustees genuinely believe a colleague must go, they should make that case to voters. The 10% petition threshold for override election ensures voters can reverse politically motivated removals. The people who elected a trustee should decide on removal.

**Due Process Prevents Railroading**: Current removal proceedings can be rushed through with vague allegations. This initiative requires specific charges, time to respond, public hearings, and clear evidence. No more surprise removals based on personality conflicts or political convenience.

**Personal Liability for Retaliation**: Officials who threaten resignation or retaliate to force removal face personal consequences. This changes the calculus - is removing a troublesome colleague worth potential personal liability?
