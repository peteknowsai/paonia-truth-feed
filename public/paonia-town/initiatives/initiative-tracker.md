- STR has existing controversy, robot is new issue
- Different constituencies may support each

### Messaging Alignment
- Both address government overreach
- Both protect resident rights
- Both respond to lack of public input

### Legal Defense Preparation
- Document all legislative aspects clearly
- Prepare response to "administrative" claims
- Cite Colorado precedent extensively
