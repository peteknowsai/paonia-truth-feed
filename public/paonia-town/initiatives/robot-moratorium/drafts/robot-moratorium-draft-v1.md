## COVER LETTER FOR SUBMISSION

09/03/2025

Town Clerk  
Town of Paonia  
214 Grand Avenue  
Paonia, CO 81428

**Re: Submission of Citizen Initiative Petition - Autonomous Robot Moratorium**

Dear Town Clerk,

I hereby submit this citizen initiative petition which establishes legislative policy creating a temporary moratorium on autonomous robots operating in public spaces.

**This Initiative is Clearly Legislative Because It:**

1. **Establishes public safety policy** regarding emerging technology
2. **Creates prospective regulations** applying to all future robot deployments
3. **Sets limits on technology use** in public spaces - a fundamental policy choice
4. **Addresses community character** and quality of life concerns
5. **Provides sunset provision** allowing time for proper regulatory development

**The Initiative Does NOT:**
- Direct specific administrative actions
- Target any individual operator or device
- Interfere with day-to-day operations
- Create licensing or fee requirements

**Context - Mysterious Robot Deployment:**

In June 2025, autonomous robots appeared on Paonia streets without:
- Public notice or explanation
- Opportunity for citizen input
- Clear ownership or purpose
- Safety protocols or oversight

This unilateral deployment of surveillance-capable technology demonstrates the urgent need for democratic input on how technology affects our community.

**Legal Framework:**

Per C.R.S. §§ 31-15-101 and 31-15-401, statutory municipalities have police power authority to protect public health, safety, and welfare. Establishing a moratorium on potentially hazardous or intrusive technology is a classic exercise of this legislative power.

Per *Vagneur v. City of Aspen*, 295 P.3d 493 (Colo. 2013), the initiative power must be "liberally construed." Creating temporary moratoria while policy is developed is quintessentially legislative.

**Pattern Recognition:**

This mysterious robot deployment coincides suspiciously with:
- Your rejection of the STR initiative
- Approval of $50,000 surveillance camera system
- Pattern of expanding surveillance while blocking democratic participation

The People have the right to pause and evaluate new technologies through democratic process.

**Simple and Reasonable:**

This initiative simply says: "Let's pause autonomous robots until we can have a public discussion about their appropriate use." It:
- Creates no bureaucracy
- Requires no fees or permits
- Exempts emergency response
- Expires automatically in 2027
- Encourages proper public process

**Key Legislative Elements:**

- Establishes temporary policy moratorium
- Creates general prohibition with specific exemptions
- Applies prospectively to all operators
- Sets automatic expiration date
- Addresses public safety and privacy

These are textbook legislative functions establishing community standards.

Please confirm receipt and acceptance of this petition for circulation within five (5) business days. Any concerns should be provided in writing.

The fundamental question - should autonomous robots operate in our public spaces without public input or oversight - is exactly the type of policy question voters must decide.

Respectfully submitted,

Pete McCarthy
119 1/2 Dorris Ave, Paonia CO, 81428
