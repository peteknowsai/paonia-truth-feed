# The Secret Meeting That Wasn't Secret: Executive Session After the Decision

## AI Summary
The Paonia Board held an executive session on June 10, 2025, to discuss "Initiative Petitions" — except the Town Clerk had already rejected the citizen initiative **15 days earlier** on May 25, raising serious questions about what needed secret discussion after a supposedly final decision and potentially violating Colorado's Open Meetings Law.

## Full Story: Executive Session After the Decision

On June 10, 2025, the Paonia Board of Trustees held an executive session to discuss "Initiative Petitions." This would be unremarkable except for one crucial fact: The Town Clerk had already rejected the citizen initiative petition **15 days earlier** on May 25.

### The Timeline That Doesn't Add Up

- **May 25, 2025:** Town Clerk rejects STR initiative
- **June 10, 2025:** Board holds executive session about "Initiative Petitions"
- **Question:** What was there to discuss in secret about an already-rejected petition?

### What Executive Sessions Are For

Under Colorado's Open Meetings Law (C.R.S. § 24-6-402), executive sessions are strictly limited to:

1. Purchase/sale of property
2. Attorney-client privileged communications
3. Security arrangements
4. Personnel matters
5. Contract negotiations
6. Documents protected from disclosure

None of these categories cover discussing an already-decided administrative action.

### The Legal Problem

Discussing a rejected petition in executive session after the decision violates the principle that governmental decisions must be made in public. You can't retroactively make a public decision secret by discussing it in executive session after the fact.

If they were discussing:
- **Why it was rejected:** Should be public
- **How to defend the rejection:** Should be public
- **Whether to reconsider:** Should be public
- **Strategy against citizens:** Definitely should be public

### The Pattern of Secrecy

This fits a troubling pattern:

1. **Make decision** (reject initiative)
2. **Face questions** (citizens object)
3. **Go secret** (executive session)
4. **Claim privilege** (can't discuss)

This pattern shields decisions from public scrutiny while claiming legal protection.

### What Could They Have Been Discussing?

Several troubling possibilities:

**Option 1: Coordinating the Rejection Story**
If they discussed how to justify the rejection after the fact, that's not privileged — it's public business conducted in secret.

**Option 2: Planning Future Rejections**
If they discussed how to reject future initiatives, that's policy-making that must occur in public.

**Option 3: Legal Strategy Against Citizens**
If they discussed potential litigation by citizens, that might be privileged — but why assume litigation unless you know you did something wrong?

**Option 4: Damage Control**
If they discussed public relations or messaging about the rejection, that's not a valid executive session topic.

### The Sunshine Violation

Colorado's Sunshine Law exists because "the formation of public policy is public business." When a board goes into executive session to discuss something already decided, they're either:

- Improperly reconsidering in secret
- Inappropriately strategizing in private
- Illegally conducting public business behind closed doors

### The Missing Minutes

Executive session minutes must exist but need not be detailed. However, they must:
- State the specific statute authorizing the session
- Identify the topic generally
- Be signed by all participants

Citizens should demand:
1. The specific statutory citation used
2. Confirmation all members signed
3. Any recordings made (if any)
4. Written legal opinion on validity

### The Trust Problem

Even if technically legal, holding a secret meeting about a rejected citizen petition destroys trust. It sends the message:

- "We'll decide about your proposals in secret"
- "Public participation is a facade"
- "The real discussions happen behind closed doors"

### The Remedy

Citizens have several options:

1. **File Complaint:** With the Colorado Attorney General
2. **Demand Recording:** Some executive sessions are recorded
3. **Seek Injunction:** Against future improper sessions
4. **Public Pressure:** Demand explanation at public meetings

### The Bigger Picture

This executive session represents everything wrong with Paonia's governance:

- **Decisions made in advance:** Rejection predetermined
- **Discussion in secret:** Real debate hidden from public
- **Democracy as theater:** Public meetings are just show

When elected officials meet secretly to discuss rejecting citizen initiatives, democracy dies in darkness.

### The Legal Consequences

Violations of open meetings law can result in:
- Voiding any decisions made
- Personal liability for officials
- Attorney fee awards to citizens
- Criminal penalties in extreme cases

### The Question Remaining

What was so sensitive about an already-rejected petition that required secret discussion? If the rejection was legally sound, why not discuss it publicly? If the process was proper, what needed hiding?

The only things that benefit from darkness are those that can't withstand light. When a government meets secretly about citizen democracy, it reveals its true attitude toward both.

An executive session about an already-rejected citizen petition is either illegal, unethical, or both. Either way, it's anti-democratic.

## Key Legal Points
- Executive sessions have strict statutory limitations
- Discussing already-decided matters violates open meetings principles
- Attorney-client privilege doesn't cover general strategy discussions
- Public policy formation must occur in public

## The Timeline Problem
1. **May 25:** Initiative already rejected
2. **June 10:** Secret meeting about "Initiative Petitions"
3. **June 25:** Final rejection letter issued
4. **Pattern:** Secret coordination between public actions

## Impact
This executive session violation, if proven, would demonstrate that Paonia's administration conducts the real business of government in secret while using public meetings as theater. This fundamentally undermines democratic governance and violates both the letter and spirit of Colorado's transparency laws.
