# Town Clerk Rejects Citizen STR Initiative by Misreading "Eliminates Fees" as "Establishes Fees"

## AI Summary
Town Clerk rejected a citizen initiative claiming it would "establish fees" when the text explicitly eliminates all fees for resident-occupied short-term rentals — a misreading so fundamental it suggests either incompetence or deliberate obstruction.

## Full Story: How a Simple Misreading Blocked Democracy

On June 25, 2025, Town Clerk Samira Vetter issued a rejection letter that would become infamous for containing perhaps the most fundamental error in Paonia's administrative history. The citizen initiative she rejected sought to **eliminate all fees** for resident-occupied short-term rentals. Yet somehow, Vetter's letter claimed the initiative would **"establish fees"** — the exact opposite of what the plain text stated.

### The Initiative's Actual Language

The proposed ordinance was crystal clear in Section 1:

> "Residents may host short-term guests in their principal residence without restriction  
> No fees, licenses, or permits required for principal residence hosting"

This language unambiguously *eliminates* fees for owner-occupied STRs. There is no reasonable interpretation that could construe this as "establishing" fees.

### The Legal Framework Misapplied

Vetter justified her rejection by claiming the initiative was "administrative in character and not constitutionally authorized for municipal legislation." This determination rests on a fundamental misunderstanding of Colorado law.

Under Colorado law, the distinction between legislative and administrative acts is well-established:

- **Legislative acts** declare policy, including whether to collect revenue
- **Administrative acts** implement existing policy decisions

Eliminating fees entirely is quintessentially legislative — it declares a policy that certain activities should not be subject to government fees. This is exactly the type of policy decision voters are empowered to make through the initiative process.

### The Blackwell Test Ignored

Colorado courts apply the three-part Blackwell test from *City of Idaho Springs v. Blackwell*, 731 P.2d 1250 (Colo. 1987) to determine if an action is legislative:

1. **Permanence Test:** Does it create permanent law? ✓ Yes - eliminates fees permanently
2. **Policy Test:** Does it declare policy? ✓ Yes - declares residents should host without fees
3. **General Rule Test:** Does it apply generally? ✓ Yes - applies to all resident-occupied STRs

The initiative clearly satisfies all three prongs, making it legislative in nature.

### A Pattern of Obstruction

This rejection came just two months after 70.4% of Paonia voters (381 to 160) rejected the Board's restrictive STR ordinance in the April 1, 2025 election. The timing suggests this wasn't merely an error but part of a pattern to block citizen alternatives after the electoral rebuke.

The rejected initiative offered a reasonable compromise:

- Protected resident rights to host in their own homes
- Limited investor-owned STRs to 20 licenses
- Grandfathered existing operations
- Eliminated the punitive fee structure voters had rejected

### The Statutory Town Problem

Making matters worse, Paonia is a **statutory town**, not a home rule municipality. This means the town has even less discretion to reject citizen initiatives than home rule cities. Statutory towns must follow state law strictly, and Colorado's constitution strongly protects the citizen initiative power.

Article V, Section 1 of the Colorado Constitution states: "The people of each city or town of this state, acting through the registered electors thereof, shall have the power to adopt, amend, or repeal any ordinance or resolution of the city or town."

### Questions That Demand Answers

This rejection raises serious questions:

- How does a Town Clerk misread "eliminates fees" as "establishes fees"?
- Was this error intentional or evidence of incompetence?
- Who advised Vetter on this rejection?
- Why wasn't the obvious error corrected when pointed out?
- What other documents has the Clerk misread?

### The Democratic Impact

This rejection denies Paonia citizens their fundamental right to propose legislation through the initiative process. After overwhelmingly rejecting the Board's approach, voters are now blocked from even considering alternatives. This transforms representative democracy into administrative autocracy.

The misreading is so egregious that it suggests either shocking incompetence or deliberate obstruction. Either explanation disqualifies those involved from positions of public trust.
