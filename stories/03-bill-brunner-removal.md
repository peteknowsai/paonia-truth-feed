# Why Paonia Needs Trustee Protection: The Bill Brunner Case Study in Democratic Breakdown

## AI Summary
The removal of Trustee Bill Brunner demonstrates why Paonia needs the Trustee Protection Initiative — when 227 voters elect someone with 67.7% support, four trustees shouldn't be able to overturn that choice after the town administrator threatens to resign unless the elected official is removed.

## Full Story: 227 Voters Overruled by Just 4 Trustees

The removal of Trustee Bill Brunner on August 15, 2024, isn't just one story — it's THE story that explains why democratic safeguards matter. When an elected official who won with 67.7% of the vote can be removed by just four other trustees, we're not living in a democracy. We're living in an oligarchy with elections for show.

### The Timeline of Democratic Failure

**November 2018:** Bill Brunner wins a Colorado Open Records Act lawsuit against Paonia. Judge Steven Schultz finds town officials "failed to exercise reasonable diligence or reasonable inquiry" in handling public records requests. The town is ordered to pay Brunner's legal fees. This establishes Brunner as someone willing to fight for transparency.

**April 2024:** Brunner runs for trustee on a platform of transparency and accountability. He wins decisively with 227 votes out of 335 cast — a 67.7% mandate. The voters send a clear message: they want oversight.

**July 2024:** Just three months into his four-year term, tensions emerge. Brunner asks tough questions. He requests documents. He does exactly what 227 voters elected him to do.

**August 1, 2024:** Town Administrator Stefen Wynn plays his card. He offers his resignation, citing "repeated and inappropriate criticism from Brunner." But here's the catch — he'll withdraw his resignation if Brunner is removed. It's not a resignation. It's an ultimatum.

**August 15, 2024:** The Board makes its choice. In a 4-1 vote, they remove Brunner:
- **For Removal:** Stelter, Czech, Valentine, Hunter
- **Against:** Swartz
- **Couldn't Vote:** Mayor Smith (as charging officer), Brunner (on his own removal)

Four trustees overturn the will of 227 voters.

### The Vote Breakdown

- **For Removal (4):** Trustees Stelter, Czech, Valentine, and Hunter
- **Against Removal (1):** Trustee Swartz
- **Could Not Vote:** Mayor Smith (as charging officer) and Brunner (on his own removal)

This means 227 voters' democratic choice was nullified by just 4 trustees.

### The CORA Victory That Made Him a Target

In November 2018 — six years before his removal — Brunner won a significant Colorado Open Records Act (CORA) lawsuit against the Town of Paonia. Judge Steven Schultz found that town officials "failed to exercise reasonable diligence or reasonable inquiry" in responding to Brunner's records requests. The court ordered the town to pay Brunner's legal fees.

This established Brunner as someone willing to use legal tools to ensure government transparency — exactly the kind of oversight voters want from their elected officials.

### The 2024 Election Mandate

In April 2024, Brunner ran for trustee on a platform of transparency and accountability. He won decisively with 227 votes out of 335 cast (67.7% of the vote). The voters clearly wanted someone who would provide real oversight.

### The Administrator's Ultimatum

Just three months into Brunner's four-year term, Town Administrator Stefen Wynn threatened to resign, citing "repeated and inappropriate criticism from Brunner." But this wasn't a simple resignation — it was conditional. Wynn indicated he would withdraw his resignation if Brunner was removed.

This created an impossible dynamic:
- Keep the elected trustee chosen by 227 voters
- Or keep the appointed administrator

The Board chose the administrator.

### The Vague Charges

The charges against Brunner were notably vague:
- "Harassment" of staff
- "Inappropriate criticism"
- "Disruptive behavior"

No specific examples were provided publicly. When trustees who ask questions and request records are labeled as "harassing," it chills all oversight activities.

### The Pattern of Retaliation

Brunner's story follows a clear pattern:
1. **Exercise Oversight:** Win CORA lawsuit, demand transparency
2. **Face Retaliation:** Be labeled as "disruptive" or "harassing"
3. **Get Removed:** Have your elected position stripped away

This pattern ensures future trustees think twice before asking hard questions or requesting documents.

### The Democratic Math Doesn't Add Up

- **227 voters:** Elected Brunner
- **4 trustees:** Removed him
- **Democratic ratio:** 57 to 1

For every trustee who voted to remove, 57 citizens had voted to elect. That's not democracy. That's arithmetic autocracy.

### Why This Demands the Trustee Protection Initiative

The proposed Trustee Protection Initiative would require UNANIMOUS consent of all other trustees to remove an elected official. Here's why the Brunner case proves we need it:

**1. Administrators Shouldn't Trump Voters**
No appointed official should be able to force out elected representatives. The initiative explicitly prohibits using resignation threats to coerce removal.

**2. Oversight Isn't Harassment**
Brunner was removed for "harassment" — which apparently means asking questions and requesting documents. The initiative specifically protects CORA requests and questioning staff.

**3. Removal Should Be Extraordinary**
When someone wins 67.7% of the vote, their removal should require extraordinary circumstances and overwhelming consensus. Not a simple majority. Not a 4-1 vote. Unanimous consent.

**4. Due Process Matters**
The charges against Brunner were vague. The initiative requires clear charges, specific evidence, and proper procedures.

### The Broader Context

This isn't happening in isolation. The same administration that removed Brunner has:
- Rejected citizen initiatives with demonstrably false readings
- Held illegal executive sessions about already-decided matters
- Deployed surveillance technology without public notice
- Refused to provide audit logs and transparency records
