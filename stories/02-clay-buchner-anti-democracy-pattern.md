# The Clay Buchner Files: From Pagosa Springs Failure to Paonia's Anti-Democracy Attorney

## AI Summary
Town Attorney Clay Buchner, who admitted blocking initiatives would prevent "bankruptcy," was previously fired from Pagosa Springs after failing to defend voter-approved fees, researched how to sue voters who approved oversight by 3-to-1 margin, and now misapplies Home Rule law to a Statutory Town.

## Full Story: A History of Fighting Democracy

Clay Buchner isn't just Paonia's town attorney — he's a specialist in blocking citizen initiatives, with a documented history spanning multiple Colorado towns. His pattern is consistent: protect government revenue, oppose voter initiatives, and when voters win anyway, research ways to overturn their victories.

### The Bankruptcy Confession

In his July 2, 2025 memo to Paonia's Board of Trustees, Buchner revealed his true philosophy:

> **"Imagine if citizen-initiated provisions could eliminate fees for administrative services provided by local government, the result would be bankruptcy of the Town."**

This single sentence exposes everything. To Buchner, democracy is acceptable only when it doesn't affect revenue. Citizens can vote, but only if they vote to pay. They can propose initiatives, but only if those initiatives generate fees. Democracy ends where the budget begins.

### The Pagosa Springs Pattern

To understand Buchner's approach, we must examine his track record in Pagosa Springs, where he served as Town Attorney from March 2020 until being replaced following a catastrophic legal failure.

#### The STR Fee Debacle (2022)

In April 2022, Pagosa Springs voters narrowly approved a workforce housing fee on short-term rentals — $150 per month per bedroom. The vote was close: just 11 votes separated the two sides. On June 10, 2022, STR owners filed suit challenging the voter-approved fee (*Clinton James Alley et. al. v. Town of Pagosa Springs*, Case No. 2022CV30035).

What happened next defies belief:

- **December 26, 2022:** Judge Jeffrey Wilson struck down the voter-approved fees
- **December 28, 2022:** Judge Wilson vacated his own order, stating "The order issued on 12/26/22 in this case was issued in error and is vacated"

A judge reversing himself within 48 hours and calling his own ruling an "error" is virtually unprecedented. This should have been a gift to any competent attorney — the judge essentially admitted he was wrong to strike down the voter's will.

Yet Buchner failed to capitalize on this reversal. According to the Pagosa Daily Post, "Clay Buchner, failed to effectively defend the desires of the Town voters. (Following that failure, Mr. Buchner was replaced as Town attorney.)"

#### The TIF Initiative (2020)

Even earlier, Buchner showed his antipathy toward voter initiatives. When Pagosa Springs voters approved by a 3-to-1 margin a requirement for voter approval of Tax Increment Financing (TIF) subsidies over $1 million, Buchner researched ways for the town to sue its own voters.

He analyzed the Wheat Ridge case to suggest the initiative might be invalid, though eventually advised against litigation, noting "the Town would be going against itself, and against its voters and constituents."

### The Statutory Town Deception

Perhaps most egregious is Buchner's misapplication of law in Paonia. He routinely cites Home Rule municipality cases like *Vagneur v. Aspen* and *Witcher v. Durango* to justify rejecting initiatives. But there's one massive problem: **Paonia is a Statutory Town, not a Home Rule municipality.**

This distinction matters enormously:
- **Home Rule cities** have broad powers to limit initiatives
- **Statutory towns** must follow state law strictly
- **Statutory towns** have less discretion to reject citizen proposals

Buchner knows this. Any first-year law student knows this. Yet he continues applying the wrong legal framework, giving Paonia powers it doesn't have to block initiatives it must accept.

### The Pattern Across Towns

**Pagosa Springs (2020):** 
- Voters approve TIF oversight by 3-to-1 margin
- Buchner researches how the town could sue its own voters
- Analyzes cases to invalidate the initiative
- Eventually admits: "the Town would be going against itself"

**Pagosa Springs (2022):**
- Voters narrowly approve STR fees for workforce housing
- STR owners sue to overturn
- Judge strikes down fees, then reverses himself calling it "error"
- Buchner fails to capitalize on this gift
- Gets fired for failing to defend voter will

**Paonia (2025):**
- 70.4% of voters reject STR restrictions
- Citizens propose compromise initiative
- Buchner advises rejection based on "bankruptcy" fears
- Misapplies Home Rule law to Statutory Town
- Claims eliminating fees is "administrative" not "legislative"

### The Constitutional Absurdity

Buchner's position creates an absurd constitutional paradox. If citizens can't eliminate fees through initiatives because it would cause "bankruptcy," then:
- Voters could never eliminate parking fees
- Citizens couldn't vote to make libraries free
- Initiatives couldn't establish free public services
- Democracy would be subordinate to revenue generation

This transforms government from servant to master, with citizens unable to control how they're charged for services.

### The Ethics of Anti-Democracy Lawyering

Buchner's approach raises profound ethical questions:

1. **Is he serving the public or protecting revenue?** His "bankruptcy" confession suggests revenue trumps rights.
2. **Why does he consistently oppose voter initiatives?** Across multiple towns, the pattern is unmistakable.
3. **Is misapplying law to a Statutory Town incompetence or strategy?** The error is too fundamental to be accidental.
4. **Should an attorney who researches suing voters represent any town?** His Pagosa Springs research reveals his mindset.

### The Buchner Doctrine

What emerges from Buchner's career is a coherent anti-democracy doctrine:
- Revenue protection supersedes citizen rights
- Initiatives are threats, not tools of democracy
- When voters win, find ways to invalidate
- Use complexity to confuse and obstruct
- Claim technical violations to avoid substance

This isn't legal analysis — it's legal warfare against citizen participation.

## Timeline
- **March 2020:** Buchner begins as Pagosa Springs Town Attorney
- **2020:** Researches how to sue voters over TIF initiative
- **April 2022:** Voters approve STR fees in Pagosa Springs
- **December 2022:** Judge reverses himself on STR fees
- **Early 2023:** Buchner fired from Pagosa Springs
- **2024:** Buchner becomes Paonia Town Attorney
- **July 2, 2025:** Issues "bankruptcy" memo blocking initiatives

## Impact
Buchner's philosophy effectively nullifies the constitutional right to citizen initiatives whenever those initiatives might affect town revenue. This transforms democracy into a pay-to-play system where citizens can only vote for more fees, never fewer.
