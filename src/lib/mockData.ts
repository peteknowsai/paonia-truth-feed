    title: 'Town Clerk rejects citizen STR initiative by misreading "eliminates fees" as "establishes fees"',
    content: 'AI Analysis: June 25, 2025 rejection letter from Town Clerk Samira Vetter claims citizen initiative "establishes fees" when text explicitly states it "eliminates all fees" for resident-occupied STRs. Initiative sought to abolish fees for owner-occupied properties while limiting investor-owned STRs to 20 licenses. Clerk cited administrative vs. legislative distinction but fee elimination is clearly legislative policy decision under Colorado law. Misreading of plain text raises questions about competence or deliberate obstruction.',

    content: 'AI Analysis: July 2, 2025 memo from Town Attorney Clay Buchner states: "Imagine if citizen-initiated provisions could eliminate fees for administrative services provided by local government, the result would be bankruptcy of the Town." This admission reveals revenue protection, not legal analysis, drives initiative rejection. Buchner was previously replaced as Pagosa Springs attorney after failing to defend voter-approved STR fees that judge struck down then reversed his own order 2 days later calling it "error." Pattern suggests results-oriented legal advice designed to block citizen participation.',

Board had passed Resolution 08-2025 formally urging voters to vote NO against repeal, opposing their own constituents.

Board provided no data supporting claims about corporate ownership or negative impacts when passing ordinance.',

Brunner removed August 2025.',
