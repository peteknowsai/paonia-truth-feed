Initiatives include: 1) STR Rights - protecting resident hosting after 70% voter mandate, 2) Email Transparency - requiring preservation of audit logs, 3) Executive Session Recording - mandating eventual public release, 4) Robot Moratorium - pausing autonomous devices after mysterious deployment, 5) Camera Ban - prohibiting government surveillance, 6) Trustee Protection - preventing retaliatory removals. Each initiative directly responds to documented abuses. Town has 5 business days to accept for circulation. Pattern shows citizens using democratic tools to reclaim government accountability after Board blocked previous attempts.',
