## Example Submission

**Title:**

```
Town Administrator Threatens Resignation to Force Removal of Elected Trustee
```

**AI Summary:**

```
Town Administrator Stefen Wynn threatened to resign unless Trustee Bill Brunner was removed from office, creating an ultimatum where four trustees had to choose between keeping their appointed administrator or the elected official who won with 67.7% of the vote ‚Äî they chose the administrator.
```

**AI Story Analysis:**

```markdown
## The Administrator's Ultimatum: Democracy Held Hostage

On August 1, 2024, Paonia faced a constitutional crisis disguised as a personnel issue. Town Administrator Stefen Wynn, an appointed official, threatened to resign unless the Board removed Bill Brunner, an elected trustee who had won his seat just three months earlier with 227 votes.

### The Impossible Choice

The Board faced two options:

- **Option A:** Keep the elected trustee chosen by 67.7% of voters
- **Option B:** Keep the appointed administrator

They chose Option B. In a 4-1 vote, democracy lost.

### The Numbers Don't Lie

**Democratic math:**

- 227 citizens voted for Brunner
- 4 trustees voted to remove him
- Ratio: 57 voters overruled per trustee

This isn't democracy. It's arithmetic autocracy.

### The Pattern of Control

This wasn't about harassment or disruption. It was about control:

1. Brunner asked tough questions
2. Brunner requested public records
3. Brunner did what 227 voters elected him to do
4. The administrator couldn't handle oversight

### The Bottom Line

When an unelected administrator can force out an elected official by threatening to quit, democracy is broken. The Trustee Protection Initiative would prevent this by requiring unanimous consent for removal. Until then, your vote only matters if administrators approve of your choice.
```

## Remember

You're not just reporting facts ‚Äî you're analyzing patterns, connecting dots, and showing citizens how their democracy is being undermined. Every story should answer: "Why should citizens care about this?"

Focus on government accountability, not personalities. Show patterns, not just incidents. Explain impact, not just events.

The stories in `Projects/paonia-truth-feed/stories` directory are your examples. Study them. Learn their structure. Then find new angles and fresh outrages to document.

Democracy dies in darkness. Your job is to turn on the lights.
